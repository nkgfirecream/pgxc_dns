pgxc_dns for Postgres-XC 1.0+
==============================

This Postgres-XC extension implements functions and views to returns the zone 
information of a subdomain based on the relative usage of the coordinators 
for use in a Bind sdb implementation. 

The view when configured with SDB will allow automatic load balancing and high 
availability across coordinators. 

Building
--------

PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH make USE_PGXS=1 
sudo PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/:$PATH make USE_PGXS=1 install

(assuming you have Postgres-XC 1.0 in /usr/local/pgsql).

I've tested on CentOS 6.3 only, but other *nix's should also work.

Configuration
-------------

To configure SDB, install in on each coordinator. On CentOS 6.3, the following
command could be used.
> yum install bind bind-sdb

On each coordniator, the subdomain needs to be created and the database 
connection established pointing the the view pgxc_dns_zone. 
> vi /etc/named.conf

zone "xc.stormdb.us" IN {
        type master;
        database "pgsql  postgres    pgxc_dns_zone     localhost postgres pass";
};

The main zone record of the parent zone needs to point to the coordinators
for the NS records of the sub domain. For example:

> vi /var/named/stormdb.us.zone

$ORIGIN stormdb.us.
$TTL            0
@                 IN SOA           stormdb.us.  root.stormdb.us. (
100     ; serial
0      ; refresh
0      ; retry
0      ; expiry
0 )    ; minimum
@                   IN NS          ns1.stormdb.us.
@                   IN A           127.0.0.1
ns1                 IN A           127.0.0.1

xc.stormdb.us.      IN      NS     c1.xc.stormdb.us.
xc.stormdb.us.      IN      NS     c2.xc.stormdb.us.
c1.xc.stormdb.us.   IN      A      192.168.122.15
c2.xc.stormdb.us.   IN      A      192.168.122.16


Usage
-----

The following parameters can be set in the postgresql.conf file:

pgxc_dns.zone:    The domain or subdomain controlled by the name servers. This
                  value should be the same on all coordinators in the cluster. 
                  Default: NULL
                  Example: xc.stormdb.us

pgxc_dns.name     The A record that clients will use to connect to the cluster. 
                  This value should be the same on all coordinators in the 
                  cluster.
                  Default: NULL
                  Example: coord

pgxc_dns.host     The host record that will be associated with the A record. 
                  This should correspond to the IP address on the coordinator 
                  so each coordinator should be configured with a unique value. 
                  Default: NULL
                  Example: 192.168.122.16

pgxc_dns.zone_ttl The  time to live (ttl) value returned with all zone wide 
                  records such as SOA and NS records. This value should be 
                  the same on all coordinators in the cluster.
                  Default: 0
                  Example: 3600

pgxc_dns.ttl      The  time to live (ttl) value returned with A records. This 
                  value should be the same on all coordinators in the cluster
                  and should be kept at 0 for best results.
                  Default: 0
                  Example: 0

Example
-------

psql (PGXC 1.1devel, based on PG 9.2beta2)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# select * from pgxc_dns_zone ;
        name         | ttl | rdtype |                    rdata                     
---------------------+-----+--------+----------------------------------------------
 xc.stormdb.us       |   0 | SOA    | xc.stormdb.us. mail.xc.stormdb.us. 1 0 0 0 0
 xc.stormdb.us       |   0 | NS     | c2.xc.stormdb.us

 c2.xc.stormdb.us    |   0 | A      | 192.168.122.16
 c1.xc.stormdb.us    |   0 | A      | 192.168.122.15
